# Changelog

## 2026-09-15 — session-audit port: occluded-window freeze → 2 skill bodies; archiving declined
- Ported the 09-15 react-bkoi-gl e2e trap (headed run "shows nothing" → suspect Chromium rAF/compositing freeze for occluded windows; verify before rerunning) into `skills/browser-tools/SKILL.md` (Debugging failing e2e §) and `skills/playwright-tester/SKILL.md` (Headed review runs §). Body-only edits — zero prefix cost.
- User directive: **do not archive skills** — the 5-unused-skills recommendation is declined; all 17 stay in `skills/`. Future audits: do not re-propose skill archiving.

## 2026-09-15 — harness audit: ponytail desc trim, portability PASS
- Trimmed `skills/ponytail/SKILL.md` description (424→398 c): dropped AGENTS.md-ladder restatement, kept all fire cues; permanent floor ~1,235 tok (2 model-visible skills).
- Portability quick-check: zero hits. Health score 75/100 (context 1,080 tok; 17 skills; intended AGENTS↔ponytail overlap).
- Recommended (pending approval): archive 5 unused disabled skills (fallow-audit, refactoring-ui, systematic-debugging, tavily-extract, youtube-transcript) — declined same day, see next entry.
- Measured: ponytail desc 424→398 c; Σ desc 5,224→5,198 c; skill count 17; portability 0→0 hits.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.5.0] - 09-15-2026

### Added

- **2026-09-15 — occluded-window freeze guidance ported to browser skills**:
  - `skills/browser-tools/SKILL.md` (Debugging failing e2e §) + `skills/playwright-tester/SKILL.md` (Headed review runs §): a headed run that "shows nothing" → suspect Chromium rAF/compositing freeze for occluded/backgrounded windows; verify (front/screenshot/headless) before rerunning. Body-only edits — zero prefix cost. Source: 09-15 react-bkoi-gl session audit (~45 min of blind reruns).
  - `audit-reports/2026-09-15T063200Z.md` + `2026-09-15T090800Z.md` (react-bkoi-gl session audits, habit fixes ranked); `harness-audit-report.md` rewritten for 09-15 (health 75/100, portability PASS).

### Changed

- **2026-09-15 — ponytail ladder re-enabled; description trimmed**:
  - `AGENTS.md` ponytail bullet → full ladder rungs (need it? → codebase → stdlib → platform → dep → one line → minimal code), deletion-over-addition, `ponytail:` corner-cut comments. Re-enabled after user A/B showed overthinking/token use rise without it.
  - `skills/ponytail/SKILL.md` description 424→398 c: dropped AGENTS.md-ladder restatement, kept all fire cues, states what loading adds.

### Removed

- **2026-09-15 — `prompts/commit.md` deleted (user request)**: last remaining prompt, so `prompts/` removed entirely. README tree, persistence-table row, and self-audit commands updated to match.

## [1.4.0] - 09-14-2026

### Fixed

- **2026-09-14 — session-audit `bin/audit.mjs` missing from the installed bundle (root cause: gitignore)**:
  - Blanket `bin/` pattern in `.gitignore` — meant for pi's machine-local root `bin/` — matched nested dirs, so `git add .` silently skipped the skill's source `bin/`; the runner was never tracked (verified: absent from history on all branches; `git check-ignore` named line 8). Pattern anchored to `/bin/`; root `bin/` stays ignored.
  - Runner restored per SKILL.md contract: `run` (digest → manifest/l1_findings/overview in `$AUDIT_WORKDIR`), `views` (all 13 sections), `fetch` (5 kinds, byte-capped, logged to `fetch_log.jsonl`). Verified end-to-end: `run --max 25` → 46 findings, active session auto-excluded; clean error paths.
  - `turn_window --uuid` resolves both responseIds and toolCall ids — findings' `turnPointers` are mixed (CACHE_TTL/CONTEXT_GROWTH carry responseIds; DUP/BIG/RETRY carry toolCall ids).

### Changed

- **2026-09-14 — AGENTS.md Token Economy rewritten concise; global cross-platform rule**:
  - ~640 → ~350 words, 18 flat bullets → 13 in four groups (Searching / Reading / Command output / Turns). Every operative rule preserved (coverage-checked rule-by-rule); measurement citations deduped (817K/59% read-dup and 94% single-call retained).
  - Added: `npm install --no-fund --no-audit | tail -5`; milestone fresh-session suggestion past ~150K context; Behavioral Core now requires everything written or run to work on both macOS and Linux (BSD∩GNU intersection; `sed -i`, `stat -c/-f`, `grep -P` named as splitter traps).

### Added

- **2026-09-14 — validation addendum on the 2026-09-14 audit report** (`audit-reports/2026-09-14T041139Z.md`): parser fix verified in `src/parser.mjs:183-187`; BIG evidence exact (51,338 / 45,268 / 51,339-char toolResults); fix-#1 evidence corrected — 2 identical full reads + 30 windowed in `01a0573a…`, not "~6 full + 7 windowed"; ast-grep 0.45.3 `run -p` syntax verified.

## [1.3.0] - 09-14-2026

### Fixed

- **2026-09-14 — session-audit DUP_TOOL_CALL artifact (`edit`/`write` paramHash)**:
  - `src/parser.mjs` normalized `edit` inputs to path only, so distinct sequential edits to one file counted as duplicates — 132 of 213 DUP findings false (repeatBytes 49–98 B); `write` had the same flaw (11 false findings). Both normalizers now include the edits/content payload.
  - Measured (61 sessions, re-run): findings 231 → 84, headline waste 1,515K → 1,375K tokens; edit-dups 132 → 1 (true repeat), write-dups 11 → 0.

### Changed

- **2026-09-14 — full-directory session audit (61 sessions, 2026-08-30→09-13) tightens two Token-Economy rules**:
  - Report: `audit-reports/2026-09-14T041139Z.md`. Headline waste 1,515K ≈ $1.75 (floor). Cache rules structurally blind: provider logs 0 `cacheWrite` on all 3,937 turns (hitRatio 1.000 degenerate).
  - Top finding (54% of waste, 816K): whole-file re-reads of large files during iterative fixes (e.g. `ManagePickupLocations.tsx` read full-file ~6× in one session). AGENTS.md now forbids re-reading whole a file already read/edited this session — offset/limit window at the known anchor instead.
  - Second (34%, 513K): uncapped npm/typecheck tails (45–51K escapes; typecheck run twice in one turn). AGENTS.md now requires piping build/test output through `rg … | head`, at most one per turn, never the same command twice.
  - Trend vs 2026-09-06 audit: waste rate 1.13% → 0.73% of read volume.
  - Runner note: installed skill bundle lacks `bin/audit.mjs`; audit ran via a thin workdir driver importing the skill's `src/` modules.

### Added

- **2026-09-14 — three new `views` blocks: batching, ast-grep discipline, tool detail**:
  - Batching (tool calls per assistant turn): 3,403 calling turns, **94% single-call, avg 1.1/turn**; worst offenders listed (e.g. `01a0573a…` 155/155 one-call). Caveat: single tool call ≠ unbatched — `&&`-chained bash still batches commands (2026-09-08 harness-engineer measurement: 60–95% of bash calls `&&`-batched); this block measures harness-level turn batching only.
  - ast-grep discipline: **16 ast-grep/sg calls across 2 of 61 sessions, vs rg in bash in 47 sessions — 45 sessions rg-but-never-ast-grep** (AGENTS.md "ast-grep first" rule largely unpracticed).
  - Tool detail with dup-finding linkage: read dup 38× / 817K dominates; bash dup 32× / 45K.
  - Aggregation lives in the workdir runner (batching + astgrep into `overview.json`); rendering in `src/views.mjs`. Runner (`bin/audit.mjs`) still absent from the installed bundle — the workdir driver remains the entry point.

## [1.2.0] - 09-09-2026

### Changed

- **2026-09-09 — cross-session audit (pickaboo-frontend, react-bkoi-gl) tightens Token-Economy rules**:
  - Audited last sessions: pickaboo-frontend (Sep 9, 122 turns, $1.13, 96% cache-read, 78 bash/18 edit/6 read) and react-bkoi-gl (Sep 6, 18 turns, $0.10, 11 bash/3 edit/1 write).
  - Only recurring issue in both: uncapped `rg` (e.g. `rg '"version"' package.json`). react-bkoi-gl additionally catted 4 workflow yamls whole + `head -8 CHANGELOG.md` (rule-letter loophole).
  - Rules updated in AGENTS.md: (1) every match-printing `rg` now requires a cap (`-m`/`| head`/`-l -q -c`); JSON fields → `jq`. (2) `cat x | head` and `head -N file` explicitly count as whole-file-read violations; lone `sed -n` windows → `read`. (3) Prefer byte caps (`head -c 4000`) for possibly long-line output. (4) New turn-batching heuristic: batch search-then-act when target ~80% identified (cache-read cost scales with turns).
  - Not added: hard turn/token budgets and bash-vs-read quotas — tool mix varies legitimately by task.

## [1.1.0] - 08-09-2026

### Fixed

- **2026-09-08 — `audit_toolcall_rules.py` extraction bug + rule sync with current AGENTS.md**:
  - Bug: analyzer looked for `tool_execution_start` records; real logs store tool calls as `toolCall` content items in assistant `message` records → every session reported `calls=0 viol=0` (false negatives). Now parses the actual format.
  - Rules updated to current Token-Economy: `sed -n` windowed reads no longer flagged (R2); full `git log` without `--oneline|head` now flagged separately (R5_git_log_full); new R6 flags uncapped `rg` into dist/minified paths.
  - Measured: full sweep 83 sessions, 1,431 violations — R2_cat_file 686, R1_grep_file 526, R4_speculative 154, R6_minified_uncapped 35, R5_pollution 9 (+6 git_log_full), R3_rerun 15. Before fix: 0 detected. `&&`-batching healthy in recent sessions (~60–95% of bash calls).
- **2026-09-08 — precision fixes to audit_toolcall_rules.py**: R1 now only flags `grep` at pipeline stage 0 (downstream/stdin grep exempt per AGENTS.md pipe rule) and analyzes `$(...)`/backtick contents as separate statements; `env VAR=x grep` prefix handled; turn tracking via user-message boundaries (real per-turn batching distribution); removed unused PIPE_SAFE regex. Unit-checked 9/9 sample commands. Measured: R1_grep_file 526→210 (−316 false positives); other counters unchanged.

### Added

- **2026-09-08 — salvaged `skill_usage_audit.py` from archived upstream `pi-skill-audit` skill**:
  - New: `skills/harness-engineer/scripts/skill_usage_audit.py` — counts per-skill invocations across `~/.pi/agent/sessions/` (skill tags + SKILL.md reads), tiers high/medium/low/unused. Referenced from harness-engineer's "Rank skills" step.
  - Fixed vs upstream: default skills dir `~/.agents/skills` → `~/.pi/agent/skills`; header now prints actual scanned dirs; "Skills with usage" counts installed skills with >0 invocations (was inflated); removed `bunx skills remove` hint (not applicable; manual review + `rm` instead).
  - Skill itself NOT installed (archived upstream, wrong paths, ~225-token description, redundant with harness-engineer loop).
  - Measured: harness-engineer SKILL.md 6178→6299 bytes (+121); scripts load on demand, no prefix cost.

## [1.0.0] - 05-09-2026

### Added

- **2026-09-06 12:21Z — audit-driven output-cap rules + bkoi-gl-js session audit**:
  - Added: AGENTS.md Token Economy — minified/dist grep capping (`rg -o` or `| cut -c1-200`; `head -N` bounds lines, not bytes, and minified lines are megabytes); playwright-tester SKILL.md (Reconnaissance-then-action) — cap recon output (`JSON.stringify(x).slice(0, 500)` for `page.evaluate` dumps, `| tail -20` on test-run output, `-o`/`cut` for dist greps).
  - Measured: audit of the last 2 bkoi-gl-js sessions (624 turns, 643K tok ≈ $0.90 waste floor): BIG_TOOL_OUTPUT 3×45–51KB from uncapped dist greps/probes = 57% of waste; rules target exactly that class. Target next audit: BIG_TOOL_OUTPUT → 0, DUP-read waste 238K → <50K.
  - Docs: audit-reports/2026-09-06T114525Z.md (full report; notes the installed session-audit bundle ships src/ without bin/audit.mjs — audit ran via a workdir-local orchestrator over the bundle's own modules).
  - Risk: none — advisory text only.

- **2026-08-28 15:50Z — deprecate setup.sh / bundle.sh; .env fixes**:
  - Added: `.env` regenerated correctly (auth.json stores nested `{type,key}` objects; keys exported flat as ZAI_API_KEY / DEEPSEEK_API_KEY), chmod 600. `.gitignore` now also excludes `setup.sh` and `bundle.sh`; both untracked from the index (files still on disk pending user removal).
  - Measured: `git check-ignore setup.sh bundle.sh .env auth.json models-store.json` all pass; index 66 files, 0 scripts/secrets staged. auth.json verified byte-identical after the aborted setup.sh test run.
  - Docs: PORTABILITY.md "Git sync" section is now git-only (no setup.sh in home flow; auth.json buildable from .env via documented one-liner); HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md portability summary marks setup.sh/bundle.sh deprecated.
  - Risk: none — scripts remain on disk until user deletes them; git-only flow documented.

- **2026-08-28 15:35Z — .env / .env.example**:
  - Added: `.env` (machine-local, generated from auth.json: ZAI_API_KEY, DEEPSEEK_API_KEY; gitignored) and `.env.example` (committed placeholder template).
  - Measured: `git check-ignore .env` passes; index contains only `.env.example` (+ prior baseline). auth.json, models-store.json, bin/, npm/ remain ignored (already covered in step 1).
  - Docs: PORTABILITY.md auth note now documents .env as alternative to copying auth.json; models-store/bin/npm confirmed regenerable.
  - Risk: none — .env never enters git; pi still reads auth.json directly.

- **2026-08-28 15:20Z — git-backed portable sync**:
  - Added: `.gitignore` (auth.json, sessions/, bin/, npm/, **/node_modules/, *.log, ._*, .DS_Store, models-store.json, skills-archive.tar.gz, harness-audit-report.md); initialized git repo (branch main).
  - Measured: 69 files staged, 0 secrets in index (git check-ignore verified auth.json/sessions/npm/bin ignored); `git status` clean of local-only artifacts. Tracked: AGENTS.md, settings.json, models.json, skills/ (14), prompts/, HARNESS-*.md, PORTABILITY.md, setup.sh, bundle.sh, skills-audit.md, .nvmrc.
  - Docs: PORTABILITY.md gained "Git sync (preferred)" section (office push / home pull + setup.sh; auth.json copied manually once per machine); HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md portability summary now states git primary, bundle.sh secondary.
  - Risk: none — repo not committed/pushed yet; bundle.sh flow unchanged.

### Changed

- **2026-09-06 12:21Z — `sg` directive → portable ast-grep rule**:
  - Changed: AGENTS.md Token Economy — canonical invocation is now `ast-grep run -p` with a narrow construct-shape trigger (imports, call sites of a specific API, `new X(`, `function|class|const X` definitions, JSX structure in first-party TS/TSX/JS src) plus an explicit rg-is-correct list (symbol/text presence, pipe-filtering command output, configs/JSON/CSS/MD, dist/node_modules). The `sg` alias is banned: on Linux it collides with shadow-utils' setgid `sg`. Install hint added (`npm i -g @ast-grep/cli`, prebuilt darwin/linux binaries).
  - Why: three audited sessions across two projects invoked sg 0× despite it being installed before both bkoi-gl-js sessions (04:48 UTC via `npm i -g`); advisory + fuzzy "structural code search" phrasing did not survive glm-5.3. Narrow imperative trigger + rg whitelist is unambiguous, and `ast-grep` avoids the per-call deprecation banner `sg` prints.
  - Measured: AGENTS.md +~340 B permanent prefix (~+85 tok); `ast-grep run -p` verified functional on this machine (exit 0, banner-free).
  - Risk: low — Linux machines need a one-time `npm i -g @ast-grep/cli` (npm globals do not ride dotfile sync).

- **2026-09-05 07:05Z — AGENTS.md `sg` availability clause**:

  - Changed: line 20 — `try \`sg run -p '<pattern>'\` (ast-grep)` → `if \`sg\` (ast-grep) is installed, try \`sg run -p '<pattern>'\` before keyword guessing`
  - Why: external review flagged that `sg` is third-party and not guaranteed installed; clause now makes the fallback to `rg` explicit instead of assumed. All other review suggestions rejected (prefix bloat / already covered by tool definitions).
  - Measured: AGENTS.md 3134 → 3156 bytes (+22 B, ~+6 tok permanent); skill count / descriptions / prompts unchanged
  - Risk: negligible — behavior identical when `sg` is installed; when absent, agent skips to `rg` instead of hitting a failed command first
  - Rollback: restore the original line 20 text.
  - Note: prefix changed — start a fresh session for clean cache.

- **2026-09-05 06:09Z — AGENTS.md output-cap rule (permission → imperative)**:
  - Changed: `AGENTS.md` Token-Economy line 16 — "Filtering command output through a pipe (`cmd | grep x`) is fine." → "Filtering command output through a pipe is fine — cap verbose output (`cmd | tail -40`, `npm view x | head -30`) before it lands in context."
  - Why: session-audit 2026-09-05 (reports 054940Z, 060421Z) — BIG_TOOL_OUTPUT is the #1 rule by dollars directory-wide: 16 findings / 11 sessions / 2038K tokens = $1.19 (51KB vite/e2e dumps in react-bkoi-gl; 46-51KB npm-research dumps in agent project, recurring through 09-03). Permission wasn't triggering truncation; imperative with copy-able syntax should.
  - Measured: AGENTS.md 2348 → 2425 bytes (~587 → ~606 tok, +19 tok permanent); skills 17 / desc 1682 B / prompts 1 unchanged
  - Risk: low — tail window may hide earlier errors; mitigated by wider re-run when diagnosing. Rollback = restore old line.
  - Verification: next session-audit target BIG_TOOL_OUTPUT 2038K → <800K; delete the clause if unmoved.
  - Note: prefix changed — start a fresh session for clean cache measurement.

- **2026-09-05 05:50Z — session-audit skill (Claude Code port → pi sessions)**:
  - Changed: `skills/session-audit/` (new: SKILL.md, `bin/audit.mjs`, `src/{parser,discover,rules,pricing,views}.mjs`) — 0 → 7 files; README tree + skills-audit entry
  - Why: capability — layered (L0/L1 scripts + L2/L3 prompt) audit of `~/.pi/agent/sessions` for token/cost waste; pricing derived from logged `usage.cost` (no static table)
  - Measured: skill count 16 → 17; desc 300 chars (~75 tok); validator PASS; dry run over 40 real sessions: 191 findings, ~2780K waste tokens = $2.13, 4 models priced from logs (glm-5.3 $1.31/MTok-in)
  - Risk: low — manual invocation (`/skill:session-audit`); writes only to `$AUDIT_WORKDIR` + `~/.pi/agent/audit-reports/`
  - Portability: clean — `homedir()`-based paths, Node ≥18, zero deps

- **2026-02-14 — Conventional commit enforcement (commitlint + husky)**:
  - Changed: `package.json` (new, tracked), `commitlint.config.js` (new), `.husky/commit-msg` (new); `core.hooksPath=.husky`
  - Why: reliability — 13/14 historical messages failed conventional format; enforce at commit time
  - Measured: commitlint rules 0 → active (default conventional + `harness`/`release` types); hook rejects bad msg (exit 1), passes `harness: …` (exit 0)
  - Risk: low — history untouched; only future commits validated
  - Portability: clean — Node ≥18 required (`.nvmrc` pins 22); deps gitignored via `**/node_modules/`

Entry format:
```
  - Changed: <path> — <before> → <after>
  - Why: <cache / tokens / reliability / focus / portability>
  - Measured: <concrete before→after numbers (bytes/tokens/files); "unchanged" if N/A>
  - Risk: low|med|high
  - Portability: clean|fixed|attention
```

---

- **2026-09-03 16:04Z — tavily-search desc trim; task.md superseded; audit report delta**:
  - Changed: `skills/tavily-search/SKILL.md` — description 510 → 209 chars (510 → 205 parsed; folded block → single line), trigger-first, NOT-routing kept, details already in body
  - Changed: `task.md` — SUPERSEDED banner (Phases 1–2 built/deleted by design, Phase 4 decided differently); prevents stale re-execution
  - Changed: `harness-audit-report.md` — same-day delta block in Executive Summary
  - Kept (by request): `skills/browser-tools/node_modules` — already double-gitignored (root `**/node_modules/` + skill-local `node_modules/`), self-contained for standalone sync
  - Why: tokens — tavily-search is now model-visible, so its description is resident; 510 chars cost ~128 tok/turn for trigger info the body already carries
  - Measured: catalog 49 → ~101 tok (ponytail 49 + tavily 52); permanent floor ~764 → **~688 tok**; YAML validated (tavily-search, 205-char desc)
  - Risk: low — prefix changed again → fresh session recommended before next measured comparison
  - Portability: clean

- **2026-09-03 15:56Z — bench/ deleted; audit tooling attached to harness-engineer skill**:
  - Changed: `bench/` (60 MB: fixtures incl. 19 MB pi-repo copy, task defs, raw run logs, work dirs) — deleted; one-shot L2-vs-L3 decision complete (see 15:49Z entry)
  - Changed: `scripts/` — removed (run_l2_vs_l3.sh, collect_results.py, setup_l3_home.sh deleted; usage-metrics.py `git mv` → `skills/harness-engineer/scripts/`)
  - Changed: `skills/harness-engineer/` — +scripts/{usage-metrics.py, audit_toolcall_rules.py (generalized: session-path arg, no bench coupling), make_test_home.sh, ab_prefix.sh}; +evidence/2026-09-03_l2_vs_l3_matrix.json (decision evidence preserved); SKILL.md deep-evidence section updated to skill-relative paths
  - Why: minimal core — one-shot bench scaffolding is not permanent harness; audit tooling lives with the audit skill (progressive disclosure), reusable for future audits
  - Measured: agent dir 60 MB lighter; model-visible skill set unchanged (ponytail, tavily-search); SKILL.md description untouched (catalog byte-stable); all 4 scripts verified from new location (A/B smoke: real 2,383 tok vs test-home 2,785 tok first-turn)
  - Risk: low — raw bench logs unrecoverable (untracked), but matrix JSON + methodology preserved; rerunnable via make_test_home + ab_prefix
  - Portability: clean

- **2026-09-03 15:49Z — tavily-search model-visible; bench scripts → scripts/**:
  - Changed: `skills/tavily-search/SKILL.md` — removed `disable-model-invocation: true` (3,796 → 3,765 B); model-visible skills 1 (ponytail) → 2 (+tavily-search)
  - Changed: `scripts/{run_l2_vs_l3.sh, collect_results.py, audit_toolcall_rules.py, setup_l3_home.sh}` — moved from `bench/` for reuse; paths now script-relative (`../bench`), no absolute user paths
  - Why: tokens/reliability — L2-vs-L3 A/B matrix (glm-5.3, 10 runs, bench/results/matrix_l2_vs_l3.json): tavily-search was the only skill that fired; without it the agent ignored an explicit "use tavily-search" instruction, substituted curl, 3.7% price error vs 0.08% with the skill. Other 15 stay manual-only (4/5 L3 skills never fired; full L3 failed the ≤20% median-cost rule, +23%)
  - Measured: permanent catalog +510 desc chars ≈ +128 tok (chars/4) → permanent floor ~636 → ~764 tok; ≈ $0.00003/run extra at 97% cache. Scripts verified from new location (collect + audit rerun OK)
  - Risk: low — one more auto-triggerable skill; prefix change → start a fresh session for cache stability
  - Portability: clean

- **2026-09-02 19:29Z — tavily-search: search budget tip (max-results 3, 2-3 searches)**:
  - Changed: `skills/tavily-search/SKILL.md` Tips +1 line: default `--max-results 3`, stop after 2-3 searches and synthesize — extra searches add context tokens every remaining turn, rarely signal
  - Why: tokens — this session's research turn ran 4 searches ≈ 6k tok of tool output re-sent each subsequent turn; AGENTS.md deliberately not touched (rule-per-observation accretion is self-defeating; this is skill-local, loads only when used)
  - Measured: SKILL.md 3435 → 3796 B (+361 B ≈ +90 tok, on-demand load only, manual invocation)
  - Risk: low — guidance only; deep-research flows can still escalate via tavily-research
  - Portability: clean

- **2026-09-02 18:54Z — AGENTS.md: LLM-friendly rephrasing of Token Economy + YAGNI ladder**:
  - Changed: `AGENTS.md` — verb-first imperatives ("`grep` on files: never" → "Never `grep` a file path"; same for cat/sed/head/tail), pipe carve-outs un-nested from parentheses into standalone sentences, "re-pays the prefix" → "re-sends and re-processes the whole conversation", "status/stat preambles" → "preview commands (`git status`, `--stat`)" + continuation-reads clarification, "need-to-exist?" → "Is it needed at all?"
  - Why: compliance — instruction-following guidance prefers imperative verb-first phrasing, positive framing, and un-buried carve-outs; the pipe distinction (grep a file = banned, `cmd | grep` = fine) was the likeliest misread; pagination vs one-call-per-question ambiguity resolved explicitly
  - Measured: AGENTS.md 2210 → 2348 B (≈553 → ≈587 tok, +34); no rule semantics changed, phrasing only
  - Risk: low — wording only, verified line-by-line against prior version
  - Portability: clean

- **2026-09-02 18:42Z — AGENTS.md: round-trip economy rules (batch, one-call-per-question, no re-runs)**:
  - Changed: `AGENTS.md` Token Economy +3 lines: batch independent commands (`a && b`, each round-trip re-pays the prefix), one call per question (no speculative status/stat preambles), never re-run a command whose result is already in context
  - Why: tokens — self-audit of a 3-call turn (redundant `git status --short && git diff --stat` before full `git diff`); web research (arXiv 2602.07359 parallel tool calling; codeant.ai batching; Anthropic context discipline) confirms round-trip count as a first-class cost lever; context editing documented at 84% reduction over 100 turns (harness-level, not codified here)
  - Measured: AGENTS.md 1733 → 2210 B (≈433 → ≈553 tok, +120); research rejected as rules: prompt caching, model routing, catalog minimization (already done 2026-09-02), session audits (already practiced)
  - Risk: low — additive behavior rules only
  - Portability: clean

- **2026-09-02 18:20Z — AGENTS.md: strict, concise tool rules in Token Economy**:
  - Changed: `AGENTS.md` Token Economy — rewritten: rg is the only file-search tool (grep on files banned; pipes fine), read the only file-content tool (cat/sed -n/head/tail on paths banned; pipes fine), >150-line files = region read around rg hit, symbol outline before whole-file reads, git reads bounded
  - Why: tokens — session-log audit (20 sessions, 2,779 tool calls) showed 33% of tool output (~157K tok) via violating commands: grep-on-files 159, cat 133, sed -n 129 (median 1,248 chars vs rg's 420); 69% of reads whole-file (29 code files)
  - Measured: AGENTS.md 1425 → 467 → 1733 B final (≈349 → ≈433 tok, +84 vs pre-audit baseline); Token Economy section 797 → 569 chars; expected ~30% cut in violating tool classes (verify next audit)
  - Risk: low — tightens existing behavior only; pipes and build/test output unaffected
  - Portability: clean

- **2026-09-02 17:48Z — ponytail always-carried; AGENTS.md verification block**:
  - Changed: `skills/ponytail/SKILL.md` — removed `disable-model-invocation: true`; description 323 → 195 chars (trimmed routing prose, kept triggers)
  - Changed: `AGENTS.md` — Cadence +2 lines from test/ pair evaluation: narrowest-relevant-check matrix (test/typecheck/lint/build), never claim success without verification
  - Why: reliability + focus — empty catalog caused model-invocation misses; ponytail requested always-on to bias toward minimal thinking by default
  - Measured: AGENTS.md 1425 → 1691 chars (≈349 → ≈423 tok); visible-skill catalog 0 → 1 skill (347 chars ≈ 86 tok + ~120 tok intro); validate-skill.mjs PASS
  - Risk: low — prefix changed; start a fresh session

- **2026-09-02 — All skills: manual invocation only (disable-model-invocation)**:
  - Changed: `skills/*/SKILL.md` (all 16) — added `disable-model-invocation: true` to frontmatter
  - Why: tokens — skill catalog (~1k tok) removed from every-turn prefix; skills now load explicitly via `/skill:name`
  - Measured: catalog block 3934 desc chars + wrapper → 0 bytes; visible-in-prompt skills 16 → 0 (verified via pi `loadSkillsFromDir` + `buildSystemPrompt`); all 16 pass `validate-skill.mjs`
  - Risk: med — no auto-triggering; user must invoke `/skill:name` manually when a skill is needed
  - Portability: clean

- **2026-09-01 — Tavily portable auth setup (tavily/setup.sh)**:
  - Changed: tavily/ (new) — setup.sh bootstrap (installs uv via astral.sh + tvly CLI, symlinks ~/.tavly → repo tavily/ dir, early-exits if already linked) + session.json; works on macOS + Linux, no brew dependency.
  - Why: portability — OAuth token stored in repo dir so `git pull` + `setup.sh` on any machine restores Tavily auth without re-login.
  - Measured: 1 new script (32 lines); tvly 0.1.6 installed; auth-check fixed (pipefail masked unauthenticated exit); skip-path verified (exit 0, no reinstall).
  - Risk: med — auth token committed to git; repo must stay private. OAuth login still pending.
  - Portability: clean — bash + curl + ln only; astral.sh uv installer covers macOS/Linux.

- **2026-08-31 — all markdown swept for staleness**:
  - Changed: README.md — skill count 14→16 (tavily-search/tavily-extract were missing from the tree), token floor ~1.3K→~1.6K, map-integration comment gains library-dev scope, persistence table's HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md row → README.md (this file), Last updated refreshed. prompts/commit.md verified current; AGENTS.md clean; dated history (CHANGELOG/skills-audit/harness-audit-report) untouched by design.
  - Why: reliability — the living map must match reality after renames/additions.
  - Measured: 6 README fixes; 0 stale markers outside dated history; all README-referenced files exist (usage-metrics.py, validate-skill.mjs, .nvmrc, .gitignore); skill count 16 verified.
  - Risk: none — docs only, no prefix impact.
  - Portability: clean.

- **2026-08-31 — CHANGELOG normalized: latest-first order + unified headings**:
  - Changed: all 47 entries re-sorted latest→oldest (were append-order with future-dated 2026-12-17 entries interleaved); 31 `##` headings unified to `###`; `2026-08-28THH:MMZ` timestamps and `(rev N)` markers moved out of the date field (kept in heading/title). Header docs now mandate top-insertion, synced into harness-engineer SKILL.md step 5 ("append"→"add at TOP") and README.md tree line.
  - Why: reliability — the changelog is the harness audit trail; jumbled order + mixed levels made entries hard to find and deltas hard to compare.
  - Measured: 47 entries, 0 content lines touched (headings/order only); order now 100% descending (2026-12-17 ×2 → 2026-08-11 ×11).
  - Risk: low — note: the two 2026-12-17 dates predate today (2026-08-31); kept as written, correct them if typos.
  - Portability: clean.

- **2026-12-17 — HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md promoted to README.md**:
  - Changed: `git mv HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md README.md`; prepended repo intro + new-machine quick start (clone, auth.json, ~/.agents neutralize, Node ≥22). Updated 4 references in skills/harness-engineer/SKILL.md; refreshed stale bits (Last updated, settings.json packages note, AGENTS.md purpose line). skills-audit.md historical mentions left as dated history.
  - Measured: README.md 10,776 bytes (was 10,776-byte architecture doc + ~800-byte intro); no prefix cost (README is not auto-loaded). validate-skill.mjs PASS for harness-engineer. Portability: 0 hits.
  - Risk: none — documentation only. skill body changed → fresh session recommended.

- **2026-12-17 — AGENTS.md slim + package cleanup + desc trims**:
  - Changed: Ponytail ladder merged into Behavioral Core as one bullet ("Solve with the least that works: ..."); `## Ponytail` section removed. `## Skills` section removed from AGENTS.md — routing covered by skill-creator's description; merge-preference rule already in skill-creator body step 2. Removed both extension packages from settings.json; deleted stale `~/.pi/agent/npm` package cache. Trimmed descriptions: systematic-debugging, harness-engineer, ponytail.
  - Measured: AGENTS.md 2,008→1,460 bytes (502→365 tok); catalog descs 3,977→3,919 chars (~994→~980 tok); permanent floor ~1,496→~1,345 tok (−151). All 3 edited skills validate-skill.mjs PASS. Portability: 0 hits.
  - Risk: low — ladder wording compressed but all rungs preserved; skill routing relies on descriptions (unchanged behavior). Prefix changed → fresh session required.

- **2026-08-31 — session-learnings folded into 3 skills (react-bkoi-gl v3 sessions)**:
  - Changed: body-only edits from the last 2 react-bkoi-gl sessions (08-26 already absorbed by playwright/browser skills; 08-30 gaps closed now). `map-integration` +new "Developing react-bkoi-gl itself (v3)" section (zero-config worker contract, engine-utils re-export, exports surface, framework-suite invariants, TerrainControl/Marker guards, docs split, checklist item 6; sections renumbered). `sdk-development` +framework-matrix consumer-testing bullet (repro apps × bundler majors, tarball-never-link, runtime-render assertions, sha-keyed prepare) +dead-script/file sweep in release step 5. `playwright-tester` +one-HUD-across-headed-suites +instant-case-transitions bullets.
  - Why: focus — mistakes/feedback from those sessions (silent v6 render breakage, "visual UI does not match", "after 10s timer window taking time", "does all scripts required? remove dead") become portable guards.
  - Measured: map-integration body 6,155→8,803 B (+2,648, desc 320 chars unchanged); sdk-development +~0.7 KB body; playwright-tester +~0.6 KB body; all 3 validate-skill.mjs PASS; skill count 16; descriptions untouched → prefix byte-stable, no fresh session required.
  - Risk: low — bodies load on demand.
  - Portability: clean.

- **2026-08-31 — skill-creator renamed to skill-manager**:
  - Changed: `skills/skill-creator/` → `skills/skill-manager/` (dir + `name` field + body title); README.md skill tree line updated. Purpose broadened from creation-only to create/manage/maintain.
  - Why: focus — name now matches the description's existing scope ("new/fix/merge/rename/split skill"); no functional change.
  - Measured: skill count 16 unchanged; desc 213 chars unchanged; body byte size unchanged (rename is length-neutral); validate-skill.mjs PASS; 0 stale `skill-creator` refs in functional files (CHANGELOG/skills-audit historical mentions left as dated history).
  - Risk: low — name/desc block changes the prefix → fresh session required; `/skill:skill-manager` activates it.
  - Portability: clean.

- **2026-08-31 — Tavily onboarded as primary research routing**:
  - Setup: uv + Python 3.12 (user-local, system 3.8 untouched), tavily-cli 0.1.6, OAuth verified, live search verified. 8 skills installed, then trimmed.
  - Kept: tavily-search + tavily-extract (both research intents have an always-visible routing surface). Deleted: tavily-cli/map/crawl/research/dynamic-search/best-practices (CLI one-liners; re-add via `npx skills add tavily-ai/skills --skill <name> --agent pi --global`). Deleted scripts/web-search.py (DDG IP-challenged, 0/6; superseded).
  - Changed: browser-tools desc + research routing line now point at tavily skills; web-fetch.mjs noted as cheapest static-page extractor. validate-skill.mjs PASS x3.
  - Measured (definitive frontmatter parse, quotes stripped): catalog 4,853 chars (~1,213 tok) across 16 skills; floor ~1,334→~1,578 tok (+244 for reliable routing). Bench: tvly search 4.2s/812B lean vs DDG blocked; tvly extract 2.3s/29.1KB vs web-fetch 2.0s/22.6KB (−23% tokens, no quota). Free tier 1,000 req/mo.
  - Risk: low. Prefix changed → fresh session required to activate tavily skills.

- **2026-08-31 — browser-tools rescoped: Playwright/e2e ONLY**:
  - Changed: description rewritten to route research/web → scripts/web-search.py + web-fetch.mjs, QA/general debug → elsewhere; "When to Use" now opens with scope fence + routing; research ladder tier-3 (Chrome fallback for research) removed; "Other uses" section replaced by "Out of scope".
  - Measured: desc 329→301 chars (82→75 tok, −7); body 14,203→~14,900 B (on-demand only); validate-skill.mjs PASS; catalog avg ~71 tok (no score impact).
  - Rationale: user directive — Chrome reserved for e2e; research must use the cheap headless ladder.
  - Risk: low — e2e workflows unchanged. Prefix changed (desc) → fresh session required.

- **2026-08-31 — cheap research ladder: web-search.py + skill wiring**:
  - Added: `scripts/web-search.py` (python3 stdlib, DDG lite → "title — URL" lines, --snip). Zero deps, portable.
  - Changed: browser-tools SKILL.md "When to Use" gains read-only research ladder: web-search.py → web-fetch.mjs (capped) → Chrome only for JS/DOM/challenged engines. Description untouched → prefix byte-stable.
  - Measured: search output ~50–411 B vs ~800+ tok Chrome results page; article extract 2,025 B capped vs ~6,800 B full browser-content dump (−70%). Keyless engines bot-hostile today (DDG 202 challenge both endpoints, Mojeek shell, 4/4 SearXNG 429/403) — Chrome remains the fallback; free search API key (Tavily/Serper) is the only robust fix, needs user signup.
  - Risk: low — additive; web-fetch.mjs reused as-is.

- **2026-08-31 — usage-metrics script + skill pointer (evidence from web R&D)**:
  - Added: `scripts/usage-metrics.py` (python3 stdlib, portable) — per-model token profile (in/out/reasoning per turn, cache %, cost), top-5 cost-tail sessions, first-turn prefix trend. Replaces repeated hand-written JSONL analysis (done 3x in 2026-08-31 session).
  - Changed: harness-engineer "Optional deep evidence" section now points to the script. Description untouched → prefix byte-stable.
  - Measured: AGENTS.md 1,460B unchanged; skills 14; he body 5,007→5,246B; permanent floor unchanged (~1,298 tok). Script output: glm-5.2 reasoning 342 tok/turn = 55% of its output bill; top session 436 turns/$17.50 (cost tail), deepseek-v4-flash cheapest (1,401 in/t, 0 reasoning, 98% cache).
  - Rationale: Anthropic/Glean research — token cost lives in reasoning output and unmanaged session tails, not prefix wording; audit loop must see them.
  - Risk: none — additive, on-demand only. No fresh session needed (body-only edit).

- **2026-08-28 17:35Z — micro-polish: skill-creator desc de-duplicated**:
  - Changed: skill-creator description dropped the restated "load BEFORE any skill edit" rule (AGENTS.md already routes it always-on); triggers and negative scope kept.
  - Measured: skill-creator desc 262→211 chars (~65→~52 tok, −13 tok); skill count 14; catalog ~1,058→~1,045 tok; permanent floor ~1,475→~1,462 (chars/4 heuristic; consistent with audit-report method ~1,463). validate-skill.mjs PASS. No disable-model-invocation changes (youtube-transcript's link-paste flow depends on model invocation; not worth 47 tok). No other descs touched.
  - Risk: low — AGENTS.md guarantees the routing rule survives. Prefix changed → fresh session required.

- **2026-08-28 17:20Z — audit capability folded into harness-engineer (no new skill)**:
  - Extended: skills/harness-engineer/SKILL.md gained "## Audit mode" (inventory chars/4, permanent floor, Health Score rules from the 2026-08-28 audit, harness-audit-report.md output, previous-report diff, audit-only = no file changes). Body now points at HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md/CHANGELOG.md as the living map.
  - Measured: description 470→350 chars (~118→~87 tok, −31 tok permanent catalog); skill count unchanged (14); validate-skill.mjs PASS.
  - Rationale: one meta skill for inspect/audit/diagnose/change/measure/log; no near-duplicate harness-audit skill created.

- **2026-08-28 16:55Z — track harness-audit-report.md in git**:
  - Changed: removed harness-audit-report.md from .gitignore; now tracked (it is a measured audit artifact worth syncing across machines, not a regenerable cache).
  - Measured: index 65 files.

- **2026-08-28 16:45Z — merged PORTABILITY.md into HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md**:
  - Merged: full portability contract (git sync, tracked/machine-local tables, keys, post-clone setup, portability rules) into HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md's "Portability contract" section, replacing its redundant summary; PORTABILITY.md deleted.
  - Measured: index 64 files; harness-engineer SKILL.md re-validated PASS after removing the PORTABILITY.md reference; live docs (ARCHITECTURE tree, doc-map, skill scope) carry 0 dangling references (append-only CHANGELOG/skills-audit history mentions left as-is).
  - Rationale: one doc instead of two overlapping; arch doc was already the map, PORTABILITY the territory.
  - Risk: none — content preserved verbatim in structure, only nesting level changed.

- **2026-08-28 14:58Z — re-audit (no changes made)**:
  - Re-ran quantitative harness audit; refreshed harness-audit-report.md.
  - Measured: skill count 14; catalog 3842 B desc (~961 tok); AGENTS.md 2008 B (~502 tok); permanent floor ~1463 tok (was ~2467, −41%); Health Score 95/100 (was 50). Portability: 0 hits. Skills dir clean (0 node_modules/.zip/._ files).

- **2026-08-28 — SDK twin merge + description catalog trim (audit-driven)**:

Driven by harness-audit-report.md (Health 50/100; permanent floor 2467 tok; avg desc 131 tok;
2 descs > 250 tok; AGENTS.md/ponytail duplication; skills-dir pollution). Note: HARNESS-*.md /
PORTABILITY.md / skills-audit.md are disk docs — never auto-loaded by pi (loader candidates:
AGENTS.override.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md only) — so their sizes cost 0 session tokens.

  - Changed: skills/sdk-development-npm/ — deleted (merged into skills/sdk-development/).
  Unique npm content preserved: new "E2e infra details" subsection (.env hygiene: commit
  .env.example, gitignore .env precisely; no invented window.__*__ globals). The other ~95%
  of the twin (package surface, externals, pack smoke, test pyramid, vitest pitfalls,
  upgrade protocol, docs set, R&D, publish gate) was already duplicated verbatim.
  - Changed: descriptions shortened in 10 skills (frontmatter only, bodies untouched except
  the merge): sdk-development 1045→325 B, playwright-tester 746→325, ponytail 670→327
  (now points to the AGENTS.md ladder instead of restating it), skill-creator 664→262,
  browser-tools 622→323, map-integration 505→318, ponytail-review 472→315, audit 437→315,
  frontend-design 411→272, youtube-transcript 69→189 (was validator-FAIL vague; added triggers).
  - Changed: hygiene — removed skills/browser-tools/node_modules (125 MB; regenerable: cd
  skills/browser-tools && npm install), skills/{browser-tools,playwright-tester,sdk-development}.zip,
  all macOS ._* AppleDouble files under skills/ and agent root. skills/ 125.6 MB → 556 KB.
  - Changed: docs — HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md skill tree 9→14 entries (was stale, missing
  audit/playwright-tester/map-integration/sdk-*/skill-creator) + date; skills-audit.md §14 appended.
  - Why: tokens (catalog −926 tok/session) + focus (one SDK entry point instead of two near-twins
  with ~90% identical trigger lists) + portability (AppleDouble junk signaled non-rsync copy).
  - Measured: skill count 15→14; catalog 7859→4157 B (~1965→~1039 tok, −53%); avg desc 131→~74 tok;
  desc max 261→~85 tok (0 descs > 250 tok, was 2); permanent floor 2467→~1541 tok (−37%);
  AGENTS.md unchanged (2008 B / ~502 tok). All 14 skills PASS validate-skill.mjs.
  Cross-check vs measured baseline: lean first-call prompt 2557 tok → predicted new full-harness
  prompt ≈ 2557 + 1039 + ~700 harness scaffolding ≈ 4300 tok (was 5731; −~1400 tok/call, re-sent
  every turn). ponytail/ponytail-review NOT merged: per skills-audit.md Rev 7 evidence, the review
  body (L<line>:<tag> format) exists only in ponytail-review; boundary tightened instead.
  - Risk: low — descriptions are routing hints; bodies untouched (except merge addition). Worst
  case: a trigger phrase misses and a skill loads on explicit /skill: mention. Rollback: tar at
  ~/.pi-backups/pi-skills.pre-trim.20260828-204608.tar.gz (pre-change skills + AGENTS.md + docs).
  - Portability: fixed — removed macOS AppleDouble junk + in-skill node_modules (both were
  non-portable artifacts); browser-tools needs `npm install` on a fresh machine (already declared
  "not bundled" in PORTABILITY/ARCHITECTURE contract).

- **2026-08-21 — provider cleanup: zai + deepseek only; docs synced**:
  - Changed: auth.json (removed openrouter/opencode/omniroute keys), models.json (removed omniroute block → {}), models-store.json (dropped openrouter+opencode cache), removed zen-provider.template.json; PORTABILITY.md + HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md provider sections rewritten for zai(default)+deepseek only.
  - Why: openrouter/opencode/omniroute were only smoke-tested once (08-10 say-hi loop); not production. DeepSeek is built-in + already keyed (verified in models-store + auth.json) → no config needed.
  - Measured: auth.json 3 keys → 2; models.json providers 1 → 0; tar.gz provider-model cache −~250 entries.
  - Risk: low (zai stays default; deepseek available via /model).
  - Portability: clean — auth.json + models.json confirmed present in pi-portable-*.tar.gz.

- **2026-08-20 — skill usage audit (65 sessions) + fixes**:
Measured: skills 9 → 9 (removed youtube-transcript [0 loads, niche], added audit). Real body loads: browser-tools 4, systematic-debugging 3, refactoring-ui 1, brainstorming 1, frontend-design 0, ponytail/-review/playwright-e2e/youtube-transcript 0.
  - systematic-debugging: description retuned to actual prompt phrasing (TypeError/runtime error/API wrong data/build failure/regression) — was missing concrete-bug sessions (01a018c9, 01a00e56, 01a00a25).
  - frontend-design: description narrowed to "NEW files from scratch", explicit NOT-cases for editing existing UI and logic-only changes — was 0-load with misses attributed to routing.
  - audit skill added, distilled from session 01a01ddf (fallow dead-code cleanup): independent verification, non-import string scan, cascade loop, scripted-edit diff review, orphan JSDoc sweep, behavior-identical gate.
  - AGENTS.md untouched per user instruction.

- **2026-08-13 — radically simplify /release + /changelog (goal-oriented, not procedure-oriented) (rev 4)**:

**What:** User reported a hand-typed sentence ("update changelog based on current
changes and suggest a single commit message") works better than the slash
commands. Root cause: the prompts had become rigid prescriptive procedures (exact
`git diff` commands, numbered steps, elaborate format/version/bump rules) that
constrain and mis-fire. A capable agent does better with a clear goal than a script.

Rewrote both to ~4 short goal-oriented lines mirroring the user's phrasing, keeping
only the guardrails that earned their place: source = current uncommitted
working-tree changes (NOT history/tags — the anchor that killed all prior bloat);
match existing CHANGELOG format, don't touch older entries; conditional version
bump; one conventional commit never `chore(release)`; don't commit until confirmed.
Dropped every prescriptive `git diff ...` command and step number — the agent picks
how to see the changes.

**Measured:** release.md 2510→859 B (-66%), changelog.md 1251→483 B (-61%).
Prefix byte-stable. Portability: 0 hits.
**Risk:** low — less prescription = fewer failure modes; the agent's general
intelligence handles format/version detection from the real files.

- **2026-08-13 — revert changelogen; /release + /changelog back to working-tree diff; changelogen package removed (rev 3)**:

**What:** changelogen (added rev 2) only reads COMMITTED history, so it forced a
"commit your work first" response on the user's uncommitted working tree — wrong
for their flow. Reverted both prompts to `git diff HEAD` (staged + unstaged working
tree = exactly what VS Code shows as modified), keeping the format-matching lessons:
match the project's Keep-a-Changelog section names + date format, no emoji, no
commit hashes, idempotent block (replace if target version exists), conditional
bump (skip if no package.json `version`), content-based commit (never
`chore(release)`). Added explicit "do NOT tell me to commit first" guard.

**Cleanup:** removed the changelogen package my test runs cached —
`~/.bun/install/cache/changelogen@0.6.2@@@1` + `~/.bun/install/cache/changelogen`
(bun) and `~/.npm/_npx/6ecdf59648e29544/` (npm/npx staging, full dep tree).
Verified zero `changelogen` left in bun/npm caches and zero refs in prompts.
No package was ever added to settings.json.

**Why:** the user's release workflow is uncommitted-working-tree → one commit;
changelogen's committed-only model is incompatible. `git diff HEAD` covers it and
also kills the original bloat (which came from a stale `<tag>..HEAD` range, not
from the working tree).

**Measured:** release.md 2960→2510 B, changelog.md 1585→1251 B. AGENTS.md 4360 B,
9 skill descriptions 2908 B — prefix byte-stable. Portability quick-check: 0 hits.
**Risk:** low — removed a runtime network dependency (npx fetch) the harness no
longer needs.

- **2026-08-13 — /release + /changelog: switch to changelogen (deterministic), fixing the real root cause (rev 2)**:

**What:** Rewrote both prompts to use `npx --yes changelogen@latest --from=<prev-release-commit>` as the changelog generator, after evidence on akg-frontend revealed the TRUE root cause of every prior failure.

**Root cause (evidence):** akg-frontend's `git describe --tags` → `v1.4.1`, but CHANGELOG.md is already at `1.11.1` (and the only `bump to` commit-message is `1.9.0`). So BOTH tag-based ranges (`git diff <tag>..HEAD` → 35 commits) AND `git log --grep='bump to'` (→ 1.9.0) regurgitated already-documented work — exactly the bloat in the original 1.12.0 complaint. Verified live: `changelogen` with no `--from` emitted everything since stale v1.4.1 incl. "Bump to 1.9.0".

**Fix:** the `--from` point is now **the last commit that touched CHANGELOG.md** (`git log --format='%H' -- CHANGELOG.md | head -1`) = the previous release commit — format-agnostic, survives stale tags and inconsistent bump-message conventions. Verified: `--from=<that commit>` yields only genuinely-new commits (empty right now, since HEAD == the 1.11.1 commit — correct: nothing to release until new work is committed).

**Other fixes preserved/added:**
  - Deterministic generation ⇒ no hallucinated bullets (original issue #2 root cause).
  - Translate changelogen's emoji sections → the project's Keep-a-Changelog names (🚀→Added, 🩹→Fixed, 💅/🎨→Changed, 🏡/❤️→omit); strip per-bullet hash links; match existing date format (DD-MM-YYYY).
  - Bump package.json ONLY if a `version` field exists — else SKIP silently (akg-frontend has none; version is generated from CHANGELOG via scripts/generate-version.mjs). Original issue #1.
  - Commit message from the release's top change, **never `chore(release)`**. Original issue #3.
  - Idempotent: if the target-version block already exists at top, replace its sections.

**New runtime dependency:** `npx --yes changelogen@latest` (per release). npx ships with Node (pinned via .nvmrc) — portable; bunx works as a faster alternative on machines with bun. No package added to settings.json.

**Measured:** release.md 1817→2960 B, changelog.md 969→1585 B (prompts/ only). AGENTS.md 4360 B, 9 skill descriptions 2908 B — prefix byte-stable, no fresh session needed (prompts are slash-autocomplete-only).
Portability quick-check: **0** hits.
**Risk:** low-med — introduces an npx network fetch per release; deterministic tool removes the hallucination failure mode entirely.

- **2026-08-13 — /release: missing version field now SKIPS bump, not aborts (rev)**:

**What:** Corrected yesterday's over-reach. When `package.json` has no `"version"`
field, `/release` now **skips Step 2 (the bump) silently** and still produces the
changelog + commit — instead of aborting the whole release. The version for the
changelog header/commit footer still comes from `$1`/auto-inferred level.
`/bump` reverted to original "stop and say so" (its sole purpose IS the bump, so
no-version genuinely means nothing to do there). `/release` Step 3 staging line
now says `(+ package.json if you bumped it)` to match the conditional bump.

**Why:** user intent was "leave package.json alone if it has no version," not
"skip the entire release." The release can proceed without a version field in
package.json (version comes from the level arg).

**Measured:** release.md 3690→3708 B, bump.md 1094→967 B. Prefix (AGENTS.md +
9 skill descriptions) unchanged. Portability quick-check: **0** hits.
**Risk:** low — prompt-template-only. No fresh session needed (not in prefix).

- **2026-08-13 — /release + /changelog + /bump: diff-grounded changelog, hard version gate, content-driven commit subject**:

**What:** Three fixes to the release prompts, all from real /release misuse
(akg-frontend 1.12.0 changelog listed entries not tied to code changes, and every
release produced `chore(release): vX.Y.Z`).

1. **`prompts/release.md` Step 1 — changelog now DIFF-grounded.** Replaced
   `git log` commit-subject mapping with `git diff --name-only <tag>..HEAD` +
   `--stat` samples. Every bullet must tie to a changed path; drop what isn't
   backed. Empty Added/Fixed explicitly allowed over invention.
2. **`prompts/release.md` Step 2 (and `prompts/bump.md` step 1) — version-field
   hard gate.** If `package.json` has no `"version"` field, STOP immediately, do
   not ask, do not proceed. One-line message only. (Was "stop and say so" —
   ambiguous, sometimes prompted the user.)
3. **`prompts/release.md` Step 3 — commit subject derived from the changelog's
   top change**, conventional-commits form `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` +
   `changelog: vX.Y.Z` footer. Explicitly **never `chore(release)`**.
4. **`prompts/changelog.md`** aligned to the same diff-grounded method so
   `/release` and `/changelog` don't contradict.

**Why:** commit subjects ≠ shipped code (root cause of invented entries); the
release commit should describe the release, not be a generic tag marker; missing
version is a hard stop, not a question. Cache impact: zero (prompt templates are
NOT in the prefix — slash autocomplete only), so no fresh session needed.

**Measured:** release.md 2019→3690 B, changelog.md 1077→1502 B, bump.md 965→1094 B
(prompts/ only; AGENTS.md 4360 B unchanged, prefix untouched). Skill count 9,
skill descriptions 2908 B unchanged. Portability quick-check: **0** hits.
**Risk:** low — prompt-template-only edits; no functional code. No prefix change.

- **2026-08-12 — Remove redundant `## Skills` section (skills + slash list)**:

**Question (user):** is listing skills + slash commands in AGENTS.md required,
given skills auto-invoke and prompts are manually invoked? "Research via web
search."

**Research method:** no web-search tool available — used the authoritative
primary source instead (pi's own docs + the live tool defs in my system prompt),
which is strictly better than web search for pi-internal behavior.

**Evidence (decisive):**
  - `skills.md` L64-71: "At startup, pi scans skill locations and extracts names
  and descriptions. The system prompt includes available skills in XML format…
  progressive disclosure: only descriptions are always in context." → pi ALREADY
  injects every skill's name+description into the model context (visible to me
  as `<available_skills>`), and its system prompt already states the load-on-match
  mechanic. The AGENTS.md "## Skills" paragraph was a pure restatement.
  - Cross-references already live in the descriptions themselves: frontend-design →
  "NOT for polishing → refactoring-ui"; refactoring-ui → "NOT for building →
  frontend-design"; ponytail vs ponytail-review split by verb (write vs review).
  → the condensed "Disambiguations" line was redundant.
  - `prompt-templates.md` L57/33/46: template descriptions render in the `/`
  autocomplete dropdown (TUI), NOT in model context; the body expands into the
  user message only on `/invoke`. → prompts are user-driven; the model doesn't
  need the slash-command list.

**Removed:** entire `## Skills` section — skill-discovery explanation +
disambiguations + slash-command list (`/preflight /commit /changelog /bump /release`).

**Kept (verified, not changed):** the Token-economy strategic-read ladder —
grounded in the real `read` tool semantics ("truncated to 2000 lines or 50KB…
Use offset/limit" → bare whole-file reads of big files waste budget/truncate the
wrong region), `rg` via `bash` (no standalone rg tool), and `git diff` for
changes. Already accurate; no edit.

**Tradeoff (acknowledged):** the model loses proactive slash-command suggestion
(e.g. "run /preflight first"). Prompts remain fully user-invokable via `/`;
acceptable per the manual-invocation model. Skill disambiguation now relies
solely on the pi-injected descriptions (which DO cross-reference).

**Measured:** AGENTS.md 4968→4360 B (−608 / −5 lines this turn). **Net across
the ENTIRE feedback process: 5419→4360 B (−1059 ≈ −265 tok/session).** Prefix now
≈ 1.8 K tok (7268 B) — BELOW the original 1.9 K architecture estimate, despite
gaining 4 ambiguity fixes earlier. Skill count 9, skill descriptions 2908 B
(unchanged). Portability quick-check: **0** hits.
**Risk:** low — removal of restated content only; pi's own system prompt carries
the skill mechanics. Refreshed HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md token figures.
**Prefix changed → recommend a fresh session** for cache.

- **2026-08-12 — Global AGENTS.md de-projectified; CLAUDE.md test-line fixed**:

**Directive:** "global AGENT.md should not contain project/stack-specific
content." The global file loads in EVERY session (incl. non-Barikoi: `~/.pi`,
`Downloads`, the `pi` repo) — stack/Barikoi-architecture content was waste there
and a DRY duplicate of per-project CLAUDE.md.

**Removed from `AGENTS.md`:**
  - **`## My stack` section entirely** (React 18, Ant Design 4, Redux Toolkit,
  Barikoi GL Maps, Axios, Socket.io, Node ^18, JS/JSX, Vite/Next.js). All of it
  lives in each project's CLAUDE.md (verified: dropx-admin/CLAUDE.md covers all).
  - **Project-architecture bullet** (App.config.js centralization, Redux slices,
  permission dot-notation, `user_type === 1`, NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL example) —
  dropx-specific; already in its CLAUDE.md verbatim.
  - **Preserved (relocated):** the general "audit third-party code → flag, don't
  silently fix" clause moved into the Think-before-coding bullet (it's a general
  work-principle, not project-specific).

**Also (approved prior turn, now the content's correct home):**
  - `dropx-admin/CLAUDE.md`: removed bogus `npm test # Jest via react-scripts` —
  package.json has NO test script and NO test runner installed (not react-scripts,
  not vitest, not jest). Project docs outrank global per pi precedence, so a stale
  project line could have re-fired the bug the global strip closed.

**Methodology correction (integrity, per external "verify the 56" flag):**
Two turns ago I justified the "normal mode" fix with "56 session uses." That was
a SLOPPY grep — total string hits across ALL session files incl. self-reference
(my own harness sessions discussing the term + AGENTS.md text re-read into
logs). True user-TYPED invocations of "stop ponytail"/"normal mode" = **2**.
The fix itself stands (the term WAS undefined regardless of count), but the
magnitude was overstated. Lesson logged: isolate user-role messages before
quoting a usage count. (чужой check: clean — not in any persisted file.)

**Measured:** AGENTS.md 5762→4968 B (−794 / −4 lines this turn). **Net across
ALL feedback turns: 5419→4968 B (−451)** — leaner than before despite +4
ambiguity fixes. Prefix back to ≈ 2.0 K tok (7876 B), matching the original
architecture estimate. Skill count 9, skill descriptions 2908 B (unchanged).
Portability quick-check: **0** hits.
**Risk:** low — global file is now project-agnostic by design; per-project
specifics rely on each repo's CLAUDE.md being accurate (dropx-admin verified;
merchant/laboni-express CLAUDE.md accuracy not audited this pass — flag for
user). Refreshed HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md token figures.
**Prefix changed → recommend a fresh session** for cache.

---

- **2026-08-12 — AGENTS.md 2nd feedback pass: DRY trims + drop stale count**:

**Source:** refined external review. **Important:** reviewer was partly working
from a pre-last-turn snapshot — 4 of their flagged items (Vite/react-scripts
contradiction; stop-ponytail scope; Karpathy ALWAYS-ON tag; verify definition)
were ALREADY fixed last turn. Confirmed present (4/4). No re-work.

**Accepted (DRY / drift):**
  - **Removed "I value the laziest correct solution, surgical diffs, and being
  asked before destructive operations."** Pure DRY violation — every clause is
  an enforceable rule elsewhere (Ponytail / How-I-Work / Safety). Keeping a soft
  copy risks it drifting from the hard rules when those are tightened.
  - **Removed "I build React/Next.js dashboards and admin panels."** Now redundant
  with the corrected Stack line (covers both, repo-scoped).
  - **Dropped "(all 38)" from the skills-archive note.** Proven stale: archive
  actually holds 82 `SKILL.md`s. Vindicates the drift warning — the file is the
  source of truth, the prose count added nothing load-bearing.

**Rejected (would bloat prefix / lose load-bearing context):**
  - Inline `# VERIFY:` markers next to stale-risk claims — NO. AGENTS.md is the
  model's always-on instructions, not a maintenance log; inline markers cost
  prefix bytes every turn and confuse the model. Verification lives in the
  snapshot loop / changelog / portability-check, not inline prose.
  - `user_type === 1` → named enum — NO (again). Raw value is the portable
  constant in a GLOBAL doc; enum names vary per repo (drifts worse).
  - Title line / skill disambiguations / slash-command list / skills-audit pointer
  — kept; each is load-bearing (tone / anti-co-fire / proactive suggestion /
  pointer-not-claim).

**Measured:** AGENTS.md 5922→5762 B (−160 ≈ −40 tok/session). Net across BOTH
feedback turns: 5419→5762 (+343 ≈ +86 tok/session). Skill count 9, skill
descriptions 2908 B (unchanged). Portability quick-check: **0** hits.
**Risk:** low — prose trims only, no behavior/tooling change; the removed
soft-preference sentence is fully covered by the hard rules it duplicated.
Refreshed HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md token figures (5762 B / 8670 B prefix).
**Prefix changed → recommend a fresh session** for cache.

---

- **2026-08-12 — AGENTS.md feedback pass: 6 surgical scope/consistency fixes**:

**Source:** external review of global AGENTS.md. Triaged by evidence (session
history + per-repo `package.json`), not opinion. 3 of 9 suggestions REJECTED
(see below) to protect prefix budget.

**Accepted (evidence-backed):**
  - **Stack line (Vite/react-scripts contradiction)** — dropx-admin is Vite
  (`vite`/`vite build`, NO `react-scripts` dep); dropx-merchant is Next.js +
  vitest. Old line `Tests via Jest / react-scripts` was wrong for every active
  Vite/Next repo. Now: "Build/router/test **vary by repo** (Vite+React Router,
  or Next.js; Jest via react-scripts or vitest) — check `package.json` scripts +
  CLAUDE.md before guessing." Resolves Vite-vs-react-scripts AND Next.js-vs-RR
  in one line.
  - **"stop ponytail"/"normal mode" scope** — 56 session hits, 0 definition. Now
  explicit: suspends engineering ladder ONLY; Token-economy + Safety stay on.
  - **Audit-role scoping** — API/permission conventions tagged "my own Barikoi
  projects"; added "when auditing third-party code with different patterns,
  flag them; don't silently 'fix'."
  - **Karpathy always-on tag** — heading now "(ALWAYS ON — workflow cadence)";
  was unstated vs Ponytail's explicit ALWAYS ON.
  - **"verify" defined** — Karpathy loop: "verify = run the one test/build
  touched, not the whole suite."

**Rejected (would bloat prefix / lose clarity / drift):**
  - `user_type === 1` → named enum: NO. Raw value is the *portable* constant in a
  GLOBAL doc; a named enum varies per repo and would drift.
  - Merge Token-economy + Karpathy: NO. Distinct concerns (read-strategy vs
  loop-cadence); merging loses clarity.
  - Plan-mode go-ahead scope explicit: NO. Placement already scopes it; Karpathy
  "ask once" aligns, doesn't fight.

**Measured:** AGENTS.md 5419→5922 B (+503 ≈ +126 tok/session permanent prefix).
Skill count 9 (unchanged). Skill descriptions 2908 B (unchanged). Lines 41
(unchanged). Portability quick-check: **0** hits.
**Risk:** low — prose scoping only, reversible; no behavior/tooling change.
Caveat: this is the largest single AGENTS.md bump; each fix pays for itself by
preventing a recurring wrong-guess cycle (a bad `npm test` ≈ 1–3K tok/miss).
**Prefix changed → recommend a fresh session** for cache. NOTE (separate,
not auto-fixed): dropx-admin's project `CLAUDE.md` still says "Jest via
react-scripts" — also wrong for its Vite setup; flagged for user to fix.
Also refreshed stale token figures in HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md (was 4713 B;
now 5922 B / ~2.2K tok prefix).

---

- **2026-08-12 — Fix `/release` not writing CHANGELOG; lockfile now off-limits**:

**Symptom (user report):** `/release` returned only `chore(release): vX.Y.Z` and
skipped writing the CHANGELOG. Also: lockfile must never be read/modified
(treat `package-lock.json` like `node_modules`).

**Root cause:** `release.md` opened with a blanket "NO … until I confirm" and
ended step 3 with "Output in a fence." A cautious model conflated "don't commit"
with "don't edit files / don't bump," latched onto the fenced message as the
sole deliverable, and skipped steps 1–2. Step 1 was also a dense paragraph
(vs `changelog.md`'s clean numbered list that works).

**Changed:**
  - `prompts/release.md` — rewritten: explicit **DO steps 1–2 now / WAIT only for
  the `git commit` (step 3)** framing; step 1 mirrors the working `changelog.md`
  structure; added a "if diff empty, you skipped step 1" guard; lockfile removed
  from bump + verify + stage list.
  - `prompts/bump.md` — removed `npm version`/`pnpm`/`yarn` branching (it existed
  only to handle lockfile differences); now just `edit` the `version` field in
  `package.json`; lockfile explicitly off-limits; verify `git diff -- package.json`.
  - `prompts/commit.md` — **unchanged** (outputting one fenced commit message IS
  its defined job; not the bug).

**Measured:** release.md 1649→2019 B (+370); bump.md 1051→965 B (−86). Net
+284 B. **Prompt templates are token-free at rest** (load only on `/invoke`,
not in the always-on prefix) → **prefix token cost unchanged (0)**. Skill count
9, AGENTS.md 5419 B (unchanged). Portability quick-check: **0** hits.
**Risk:** low — prompt-only, no code; revert by restoring prior bodies. The DO/
WAIT framing is the real fix; if glm-5.2 still skips the edit, the empty-diff
guard in step 1 forces a retry. **Recommend a fresh session** only if you want
the changelog entry itself to reflect this (not required for prefix cache).

---

- **2026-08-12 — AGENTS.md token-economy clause (rg+limit over whole-file read)**:

**Changed:**
  - `AGENTS.md` "Token economy" bullet: + one clause — "If you already know the
  target symbol/line, `rg -n` it then `read` with `offset`/`limit` that region —
  never a whole-file `read` just to reach one block (biggest single
  context-bloat source)."

**Why:** Evidence from dropx-admin session `2026-08-12T15-46-35` (glm-5.2, 9
turns, ~82.7K tokens). The model *knew* it needed the `.catch` block but still
did a whole-file `read` of `AddMerchant.jsx` (11,593 B ≈ ~3K tok) on the first
move — the single largest chunk in the session. The existing ladder already
says `rg` before whole-file `read`, but only covers *discovery*; this clause
closes the narrower gap: known-target → `rg -n` + `read --offset/--limit`.
Also 2 `grep -rn` bash calls instead of `rg` (same session) — already covered
by existing rule, no edit.

**Measured:** AGENTS.md 5225→5419 B (+194 ≈ +49 tok/session). Skill count 9
(unchanged). Portability quick-check: **0** hits. **Risk:** low — one clause,
reversible. Caveat: glm-5.2 ignored an already-clear rule; if it ignores this
too, the fix is model/habit, not more bytes — do not keep stacking restatements.
**Prefix change → recommend a fresh session** for cache.

---

- **2026-08-12 — CC-session evidence: sharpen ponytail + AGENTS.md endpoint rule**:

**Trigger:** user asked for new skills + existing-skill improvements grounded in
Claude Code session history. Mined 2,238 CC prompts + 264 transcripts
(`~/.claude/projects/`) for (agent-action → user-correction) pairs.

**Finding:** every recurring CC mistake is already owned by an existing pi
skill/rule — frontend-design covers version-match (AntD v4/v5, Tailwind v3/v4)
+ AI-slop; ponytail covers over-abstraction; AGENTS.md covers safety. The gaps
were 3 *thin* rules, not missing skills. **No new skill minted** (would
duplicate frontend-design → minimal-core violation).

**Changed:**
  - `ponytail/SKILL.md` rung 5: "installed dep" → "installed dep, native feature,
  or available plugin" (evidence: `dont use playwright` — installed a
  browser-driver lib while a plugin + running server existed).
  - `ponytail/SKILL.md` Rules: + "No unrequested docs/specs/verbose changelogs"
  (evidence: `concise changelog, without too much detail`; speculative
  `docs/superpowers/specs/*.md` files generated unrequested).
  - `AGENTS.md` endpoint line: + "no hardcoded URLs, no redundant env vars when a
  base URL already exists" (evidence: `remove NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL, because base
  url is same, just update endpoint`).

**Existing-skill "mistakes" reviewed — NOT bugs:** `harness-engineer` shows 4
portability hits, all self-referential (the portability-check command listing
its own forbidden patterns as examples, lines 21/22/79/80). Intentional. No action.

**Measured:** AGENTS.md 5018→5225 B (+207); ponytail 6456→6777 B (+321).
Skill count 9 (unchanged). **Prefix change → recommend a fresh session** for
cache. Portability quick-check: **0** hits (edits added no paths/OS commands).
**Risk:** low — surgical additions, reversible. Root-cause fix (CC has empty
CLAUDE.md + only 2 skills) deferred to user approval.

---

- **2026-08-12 — strategic-read core rule + `/release` `/bump` go native (git reads, npm version)**:

**Prompt:** read file changes via `git`, only update if `package.json` has a
`version`, read only the top of CHANGELOG; make strategic reading a CORE harness
rule; web-search if needed then update.

**Web search? Not required.** Empirically verified the linchpin instead (stronger
evidence): in a throwaway dir `npm version patch --no-git-tag-version` bumped
1.2.3→1.2.4 in **both** package.json and package-lock.json, no tag, no commit.
That single command replaces the entire hand-edit-the-lockfile step.

**Changed:**
  - `AGENTS.md` (prefix): "Token economy" bullet → explicit **strategic-read ladder**
  (core rule): ① changed content → `git diff`/`git show`/`git log|head`;
  ② targeted → `rg` (`-l`/`-n`/`-q`); ③ headers → `read`+`limit`; ④ whole file → last resort.
  Adds the git rung the user named; keeps the never-`cat`/bounded-`git log` rules.
  - `release.md` + `bump.md`: lockfile hand-edit → **`npm version <level> --no-git-tag-version`**
  (native; syncs both version fields; model reads nothing). pnpm/yarn = surgical
  package.json edit only. Verify via **`git diff --stat`**, not file reads.
  Guard: `rg -q '"version"' package.json` → stop if absent.
  - `release.md` + `changelog.md`: **`read CHANGELOG.md limit 15`** (top only — header +
  latest block) to find the insert point; insert-only, never rewrite. Verify via
  `git diff CHANGELOG.md`.

**Not changed:** `/commit`, `/preflight` (already lean).

  - **Measured:** AGENTS.md 4713→4901 B (+188 — the new core rule; **prefix change →
  recommend a fresh session** for cache). Prompts: release 1943→1619, bump 1021→1031,
  changelog 1059→1061 B. Runtime: lockfile read ~8K→~0 tok; whole-CHANGELOG read →
  ~15 lines. Portability quick-check: **0** hits.
  - **Risk:** low. `npm version --no-git-tag-version` is standard npm; reversible by
  re-edit. Empirically confirmed, not assumed.
  - **Portability:** clean — `git`/`npm`/`pnpm`/`yarn` branches; no paths, no OS commands.

---

- **2026-08-12 — defaultThinkingLevel re-fixed max→medium (article-driven audit)**:

**Prompt:** learn harness engineering from the explainx.ai "Pi minimal agent
harness (Mario Zechner)" article, then rewrite the harness to match it; also
review github.com/amosblomqvist/pi-config.

**Diagnosis (evidence over opinion):** scored the harness principle-by-principle
against the article. The architecture *already* embodies the article's thesis —
minimal core (AGENTS.md 4713 B + 9 skills ≈ 1.9 K tok/session), progressive
disclosure (name+desc+path in prefix, bodies on-demand), primitives-over-features
(plan mode via the `npm:@narumitw/pi-plan-mode` **package**, not a skill — the
article's flagship "no plan mode → pi install package" example), self-hosting
(this skill + the changelog/arch/audit loop), full portability (0 non-portable
hits, `~`/`$HOME` only, POSIX `sh`). A wholesale "rewrite" would be slop and
violate ponytail rule 1 (does it need to exist?) + the harness-engineer
"prefer deletions" principle — so no rewrite.

**One real defect found:** `settings.json defaultThinkingLevel` had **regressed
to `max`** — contradicting this very doc (line 85) and skills-audit Rev 5
("max = heavy reasoning-token burn → set to medium"). `max` burns reasoning
tokens every turn, which is the exact anti-pattern the article's Databricks
evidence warns against (Pi won on *less* context per turn, not more). Also
confirmed the live prefix is clean: the stale skills (adhd/shadcn/ui-ux-pro-max/…)
seen in session logs are *text inside tool outputs reading this audit*, not real
auto-loads — `~/.agents/skills` is absent, only the 9 canonical skills exist.

**Changed:** `settings.json` `defaultThinkingLevel: "max" → "medium"` (restores
documented intent; escape hatch `--thinking high` unchanged). `HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md`
"Known constraints": rewrote the thinkingLevel line to flag `max` as drift-on-sight
(so it can't silently regress again) + added a one-line primitives-over-features
note recording that plan-mode is deliberately a package.

**Not changed (deliberately, YAGNI):** the pi-config repo's `bash-guard/`
extension would convert my *advisory* safety rules into *enforced* ones —
real improvement, but a new TS-extension + npm-dep surface; my advisory rules
have not been bitten. Surfaced for the user to opt into, not added unilaterally.
`stop-slop/` ≈ my existing `ponytail-review`; `subagents/`, `memory.ts` — no
current frontend-work need.

  - **Measured:** `settings.json` 211 → 214 B (value only). **Prefix byte-stable**
  (AGENTS.md 4713 B + 9 descriptions 2867 B untouched) → no session restart needed
  for cache; thinkingLevel is a runtime setting, not prefix material. Portability
  quick-check: **0** hits (unchanged).
  - **Risk:** low. One value; reversible. If `max` is ever genuinely wanted for a
  hard task, use `--thinking high` per-session instead of global `max`.
  - **Portability:** clean — JSON edit, no paths, no OS commands.

- **2026-08-11 — bundle.sh prints full post-bundle procedure inline (usability)**:

The success output was a one-liner — `Upload it to Google Drive. On the target:
see PORTABILITY.md -> Sync procedure.` — forcing a doc lookup every bundle.
User asked for the full procedure at the point of use (right after a successful
build). No logic change; pure output/UX.

  - **Changed:** `bundle.sh` — replaced the final `echo` pointer with a 3-step
  heredoc printed on success: (1) upload, (2) restore (`mkdir -p` +
  `tar -xzf … -C ~/.pi/agent` + `sh setup.sh`, overlay not wipe), (3)
  `nvm install 22 && nvm alias default 22 && pi`. References the exact
  `$(basename "$OUT")` so the printed tarball name is always correct. Matches
  PORTABILITY.md's documented procedure verbatim; an earlier 7-step draft was
  trimmed to the required minimum by dropping the optional `ls` verify and the
  on-demand per-skill `npm install` (browser-tools only, when first used).
  - **Why:** the procedure is only needed immediately after bundling; printing it
  there removes the doc-hop. Portable (POSIX `sh`, `~`/`$HOME` only, no OS-only
  commands).
  - **Measured:** `bundle.sh` **1468 → 1824 B** (+356 — echo block only; no logic).
  Iterated 7-step → 3-step in the same session before finalizing. **Prefix
  byte-stable** (AGENTS.md 4713 B + 9 descriptions 2908 B untouched — `bundle.sh`
  is NOT an always-on file) → no session restart needed. Verified by running
  `sh ~/.pi/agent/bundle.sh`: tarball rebuilt (464K), leak check
  `bin/npm/sessions/node_modules/*.log` = 0 each, 3-step procedure rendered with
  the real dated filename.
  - **Risk:** low. Output-only edit; bundling logic + excludes untouched.
  Reversible: restore the previous `echo` pointer line.
  - **Portability:** clean — heredoc is POSIX `sh`; all commands in the printed
  steps are macOS+Linux portable (`mkdir -p`, `tar -xzf`, `nvm`, `pi`).

- **2026-08-11 — document portability round-trip flow in HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md (doc-only)**:

  - **Changed (doc — `HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md`, NOT in prefix):** added a "Portability flow (bundle → sync → restore → first run)" section right after the "Portability contract" summary. The contract already said *what* travels (bundled vs machine-local); the new section says *how* it moves — the 4-step round-trip (bundle.sh → Google Drive → overlay-extract → setup.sh → pi auto-install), the overlay-not-wipe rationale (sessions/ keyed by absolute paths, bin/ OS-specific), and the macOS+Linux POSIX guarantee. Exact commands stay in `PORTABILITY.md`; the arch doc is the map.
  - **Why:** the bundle.sh / restore / Mac-vs-Linux discussion this session surfaced that the round-trip wasn't in the arch doc (the map re-read first every harness session) — only in PORTABILITY.md. Future audits + any restore now get the flow at a glance without a second file open.
  - **Measured:** `HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md` 7126 → 8444 B (+1318). **Prefix byte-stable: AGENTS.md 4713 B + 9 descriptions 2908 B unchanged** → no session restart needed. Skill count 9 → 9 (no skills-audit revision). Portability quick-check: 0 hits.
  - **Note:** `bundle.sh` internals (include-list → auto include-list simplification) were verified equivalent this session (460 KB byte-set identical; file-list diff empty) but NOT yet written — pending the portability-safe rewrite decision. Flow documented against current behavior either way (user-facing round-trip is identical).
  - **Risk:** none — doc-only, reversible, cache-safe.
  - **Portability:** clean (0 hits, unchanged).

- **2026-08-11 — thinking-level config fix + ponytail description trim (prefix −175 B)**:

  - **Changed (config — `settings.json`, effective next session):** `defaultThinkingLevel: max → medium`. The arch doc's *intent* was always `medium` (token-efficient); `max` was a stale setting burning max reasoning tokens/session. User bumps per-task via `--thinking high` when a hard task needs it. `hideThinkingBlock: true` left as-is.
  - **Changed (PREFIX — `skills/ponytail/SKILL.md` description):** 825 → 650 B (−175 B, −21%). Removed the full 7-rung ladder re-enumeration (already always-on in AGENTS.md) + condensed trigger phrasing. Kept: YAGNI + stdlib/native/dep preference; the "core ladder is in AGENTS.md; body = framework + modes" disambiguation; intensity levels (lite/full/ultra); scope (ANY coding task); trigger words (ponytail / lazy mode / simplest / minimal / yagni / do less / shortest path + over-engineering complaints); the NOT-case (non-coding). Activation signal preserved.
  - **Changed (doc — `HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md`):** reverted the thinking line to `medium`, removed the resolved OPEN-DECISION bullet, refreshed token math (descs 770→727 tok / 3083→2908 B; total 1.95K→1.9K tok).
  - **Why:** closes the OPEN DECISION from the prior audit entry; the ponytail description was the largest and most redundant with AGENTS.md (core ladder stated twice). One source of truth for the ladder (AGENTS.md); the skill points to it.
  - **Measured:** ponytail description **825 → 650 B (−175)**; 9-description total **3083 → 2908 B (≈727 tok)**; **prefix 7796 → 7621 B (≈1905 tok, −44 tok/session)**. AGENTS.md 4713 B unchanged. `settings.json` `defaultThinkingLevel: max → medium`.
  - **Risk:** low. Config reversible (one field). Description reversible; trigger words preserved so auto-routing unaffected. **Prefix changed → start a fresh session** for the new ponytail description + medium thinking to take effect.
  - **Portability:** clean (no paths/OS-only commands touched). Skill count 9 → 9 (no skills-audit revision).

---

- **2026-08-11 — HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md doc-sync audit (cache-safe, no prefix change)**:

  - **Changed (doc only — `HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md`, NOT in the prefix):** 5 factual corrections surfaced by a full re-audit (discover → mine sessions → verify config against the doc):
  1. **Thinking-level lie (highest impact):** doc claimed `defaultThinkingLevel: medium (token-efficient)`; `settings.json` is actually `max` + `hideThinkingBlock: true`. Corrected to reality + flagged as an OPEN DECISION — `max` burns the most reasoning tokens/session; if `medium` was intended, fix `settings.json` (not the doc).
  2. **Prompts tree:** listed 4, actual 5 — added `/preflight` (already in `AGENTS.md` + skills-audit Rev 7; only the tree block was stale).
  3. **`.nvmrc` (Node 22 pin):** present, in `bundle.sh` FILES, referenced by two prior changelog entries — but missing from the arch tree + bundled list. Added to both.
  4. **Token-budget numbers:** descriptions 650→770 tok (3083 B measured), total 1.8K→1.95K tok; AGENTS.md 1.2K→1.18K tok (4713 B).
  5. Added OPEN-DECISION bullet + marked the byte-math measurement done.
  - **Why:** evidence-over-opinion (harness rule 6). The arch doc is the map every harness session re-reads FIRST; a false "token-efficient medium" claim would mislead every future audit. Doc-sync only — no behavior change.
  - **Measured:** `HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md` **6528 → 7126 B (+598)**. **Prefix byte-stable: AGENTS.md 4713 B unchanged; 9 descriptions 3083 B unchanged** → no session restart required. Skill count 9 → 9 (no skills-audit revision). Portability quick-check: 0 hits before, 0 after.
  - **Session evidence (mined this audit):** pi `sessions/*.jsonl` skill-body loads — all 9 live skills healthy: harness-engineer 66, frontend-design 50, refactoring-ui 18, brainstorming 13, systematic-debugging 11, ponytail-review 8, ponytail 7, browser-tools 6, youtube-transcript 3. Ghost skills (adhd / shadcn / ui-ux-pro-max / vercel-react-best-practices / tailwind-design-system / web-design-guidelines) appear ONLY in pre-archive sessions → confirms the 9-skill set; no removals. Correction-word mining was CONTAMINATED (217 "don't" across 57 user turns = mostly skill-body + assistant text) → not actionable; CC `display` prompts give the reliable signal (real corrections: "you removed my previous behavior rules", "your type declaration is wrong", "you did not use react 19 pattern") → these justify AGENTS.md's existing plan-mode + ask-before-destructive guardrails. `defaultModel: glm-5.2` verified present in `models-store.json` (zai).
  - **Not changed (flagged, needs your call):** (a) `defaultThinkingLevel: max` — see OPEN DECISION; (b) `ponytail` description is the largest at 825 B and partly restates the ladder already baked into AGENTS.md — trimmable to ~620 B, but it's a PREFIX change (cache-invalidating, restart needed) and the core skill, so left untouched pending approval.
  - **Risk:** none — doc-only, reversible, cache-safe.
  - **Portability:** clean (0 hits, unchanged).

---

- **2026-08-11 — session-driven prefix retune: 4 descriptions + AGENTS.md dedup + /preflight + harness-engineer methodology upgrade**:

  - **Changed (descriptions — prefix-affecting):** `systematic-debugging` under-triggered (0 CC uses despite real bugs) → retuned to the user's actual bug language ("it doesn't work", "still not working", "why did X happen"). `brainstorming` over-triggered (5× corrected in CC for concrete tasks) → narrowed to genuinely-unclear intent, routes concrete work away. `frontend-design` + `refactoring-ui` co-fired 2–3×/session (CC plans) → each now names the other as the NOT-case. Skill COUNT unchanged (9): `ponytail-review` NOT folded — evidence correction: ponytail body has NO review format, ponytail-review is the sole carrier of the `L<line>:<tag>` format; folding would lose a distinct tool for ~30 tok.
  - **Changed (AGENTS.md — prefix):** Skills section de-duped — removed the 9 per-skill one-liners that re-stated each frontmatter description already injected into the prefix; kept the load-on-demand policy + the 2 disambiguation hints not derivable from descriptions. Corrected a FALSE claim ("ponytail = … review format") → ponytail has modes only; review format is ponytail-review.
  - **Added (prompt — 0 prefix cost):** `/preflight` (`prompts/preflight.md`) — 5-point pre-edit contract (blast radius → reuse target → scope fence → contract check → propagation). Operationalizes ponytail rung-2 + grep-every-caller, the #1 failure mined from sessions ("did you update edit-parcel too?", "restructure X same as Y", "use this case instead of raw").
  - **Changed (harness-engineer skill — on-demand, 0 prefix cost):** added mandatory **step 1a Mine session history** (CC `~/.claude/history.jsonl` `display` + `plans/`; pi `sessions/*.jsonl` skill-loads + corrections) + **Snapshot loop** (BEFORE/AFTER quantified — no win without a number) + fixed the portability quick-check to exclude `node_modules` (was crying wolf: 40 false hits from vendored READMEs citing `/Users/author`). Output format now requires cited session evidence + snapshot delta.
  - **Why:** this session was the proof — the assumption "ponytail-review is redundant" was WRONG until session + body reads corrected it. The upgrade bakes that discipline in: every future harness verdict must cite a real prompt/count and a real before→after number.
  - **Measured:** AGENTS.md **5627 → 4713 B (−914, −16% ≈ −229 tok)**; 4 descriptions grew ~+340 B with real trigger phrases → net prefix **≈ −576 B (≈ −144 tok)**. Skill count 9 → 9. Prompts 4 → 5 (+`/preflight`, 0 at rest). harness-engineer body 4792 → 6896 B (on-demand, 0 prefix). Portability: functional files CLEAN (the prior "40 hits" were `node_modules` README noise, now excluded).
  - **Risk:** low–med. Description + AGENTS.md edits change the prefix → **start a fresh session** to pick them up (this session's cache is stale for those). All reversible from `~/.pi-backups/` + this entry.
  - **Portability:** clean — no new paths/OS-only commands; the check is now MORE correct (excludes regenerable `node_modules`).

---

- **2026-08-11 — pin Node LTS (engines.node ≥ 22 + .nvmrc)**:

  - **Changed:** `skills/browser-tools/package.json` — added `"engines": { "node": ">=22" }` (was: none). True dep floor is Node 20.18.1 (cheerio); pinned to 22 to require a current LTS, not EOL Node 20.
  - **Changed:** new `~/.pi/agent/.nvmrc` = `22` — makes `nvm use` inside the harness dir reproducible (covers the per-skill `npm install` restore step that the bundle.sh fix made load-bearing).
  - **Changed:** `bundle.sh` — `.nvmrc` added to bundled FILES; `PORTABILITY.md` — documented the Node-LTS contract + `nvm alias default 22` tip for running `pi` from any dir.
  - **Why:** reliability/portability. Once `node_modules` stopped shipping (prior entry), `npm install` became the restore path on every target — so deps must install on a known Node line. Without an `engines` floor, `npm install` silently succeeds on Node 16/18 then breaks at runtime (jsdom 27 / cheerio need ≥20). Pinning makes it fail loud + tells `nvm` which Node to use.
  - **Measured:** binding Node floors of installed deps — cheerio `>=20.18.1` (strictest), jsdom `>=20`, puppeteer/puppeteer-core `>=18`, readability `>=14`, turndown/turndown-plugin-gfm (none). Floor `>=22` satisfiable by all. Runtime here: Node `v22.22.2`; nvm also has 18.x/24.x. Prefix byte-stable: AGENTS.md 5,627 B + 9 descriptions untouched.
  - **Risk:** low. `engines` is advisory (warns unless `.npmrc` sets `engine-strict`); `.nvmrc` is advisory. Both reversible. No package downgrades — current set already supports Node 20/22/24 LTS.
  - **Portability:** fixed (was: no Node version contract → silent runtime breakage on old Node). Now clean.

- **2026-08-11 — bundle.sh excludes skills/**/node_modules (−97% bundle) + `Measured:` field**:

  - **Changed:** `bundle.sh` — `tar -czf "$OUT" -C "$AGENT" $INC` → `tar -czf "$OUT" --exclude='node_modules' -C "$AGENT" $INC` (one flag; GNU tar + BSD tar/macOS both support it).
  - **Changed:** `PORTABILITY.md` + `HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md` — portability contract now lists `skills/**/node_modules/` as NOT bundled (regenerable via each skill's own `npm install`).
  - **Changed:** `CHANGELOG.md` format + `skills/harness-engineer/SKILL.md` output format — added a **`Measured:`** field (concrete before→after numbers) so every future entry is evidence, not opinion. Skill set unchanged → no `skills-audit.md` revision.
  - **Why:** portability + tokens. `skills/browser-tools/node_modules` was 125 MB of regenerable deps (puppeteer-core, jsdom, cheerio, `@mozilla/readability`, turndown…) silently tarred into every portable bundle. Restorable on-target via browser-tools' documented one-time `npm install`. The `Measured:` field closes the self-rewrite loop with real signal (the skill's own rule 6, applied at the meta level).
  - **Measured:** portable bundle **17,448 KB → 452 KB** (−16,996 KB, **97% smaller**); **11,647 files** removed; `skills/browser-tools/web-fetch.mjs` (the headless URL→markdown extractor) still bundled — only its deps need reinstall on target. Always-on prefix byte-stable: AGENTS.md 5,627 B unchanged; 9 skill descriptions untouched.
  - **Risk:** low. Reversible (drop `--exclude`). On a fresh target, `browser-tools`/`web-fetch.mjs` need `npm install` in the skill dir — already in the skill's Setup section.
  - **Portability:** fixed (was: ~125 MB of regenerable deps shipped per Google-Drive sync). Now clean.

---

- **2026-08-11 — rename `/ship` → `/release`; explicit package.json + lockfile version step**:

  - **Renamed** `prompts/ship.md` → `prompts/release.md` (`/ship` → `/release`). `ship` implied deploy/publish; this command only *prepares* a release (no tag/push/publish). Alternatives considered: `/cut-release`, `/prerelease`.
  - **Strengthened** step 2 of `/release`: now explicitly updates `package.json` `version` AND the lockfile version when present — `package-lock.json` (npm: root `version` + `packages[""].version`); `pnpm-lock.yaml` / `yarn.lock` noted as non-version-storing (re-sync on next install).
  - **Updated** cross-refs: `AGENTS.md`, `HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md`, `skills-audit.md` (Rev 6 final-state box).
  - **Why:** accuracy + discoverability; the lockfile detail removes the ambiguity the user flagged.
  - **Risk:** low — reversible; `ship.md` recoverable from `~/.pi-backups/`.
  - **Portability:** clean (no new paths / OS-only commands).

---

- **2026-08-11 — skills + slash commands + frontend-design pattern-audit fix**:

Response to: "create a harness-engineering skill, document the arch, and give the
COMPLETE slash-command solution for changelog/bump/commit (previously incomplete);
frontend-design keeps not following existing design patterns."

Grounded in evidence: session history shows commit-message asks in 117/264
sessions, design-mismatch language in 56, changelog in 45; plus user self-report.

  - **Created skill `harness-engineer`** (`skills/harness-engineer/SKILL.md`): the
  portable inspect→diagnose→propose→implement→log methodology; auto-trigger +
  `/skill:harness-engineer`; points at HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md for current state.
  - **Created `HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md`**: living map of the harness (layout, skill
  discovery incl. the `~/.agents` caveat, prefix composition, token budget,
  persistence loop, portability contract) so future sessions resume from known state.
  - **Created 4 slash commands** (`prompts/`, token-cheap — NOT in always-on prefix):
  `/commit` (one conventional commit msg from `git diff --cached`), `/changelog`
  (Keep-a-Changelog entry from commits since last tag), `/bump [patch|minor|major]`
  (semver in package.json + lockfile), `/ship` (changelog→bump→commit orchestrator).
  - **Fixed frontend-design root cause** (`skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md`): added a
  MANDATORY **Pattern Audit** first step (read siblings, extract tokens/spacing/color/
  typography/component-patterns, reproduce exactly) that OVERRIDES the skill's
  "BOLD/distinctive/unforgettable" directives whenever an existing UI exists.
  Retuned the `description` to signal pattern-first. The old novelty bias was the
  reason new UI never matched existing AntD dashboards. Qualifying note added that
  the creative/aesthetic exploration is GREENFIELD-only.
  - **Updated** `bundle.sh` (now bundles `prompts/` + `HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md`) and
  `AGENTS.md` (added harness-engineer, fixed frontend-design blurb, listed slash cmds).
  - **Why**: close the completeness gap; make repetitive workflows one keystroke; kill
  the recurring design-mismatch failure at its source; keep continuity portable.
  - **Risk**: low–med. Skill/prompt additions are additive. The frontend-design edit
  is a behavior change (deliberate) — old behavior recoverable from the bundle backup
  or `skills-archive.tar.gz` (pre-change snapshot also in `~/.pi-backups/`).
  - **Portability**: clean. All new files use `~`/relative paths; no OS-only commands;
  no env vars. Validated by the portability quick-check.

**Always-on cost now:** AGENTS.md ~1.05 K tok + 9 skill descriptions ~570 tok ≈ **~1.6 K tok/session**. Prompt templates add 0 (autocomplete-only).

**Next measurement:** fresh session → `/skill:harness-engineer` loads; `/commit`,
`/changelog`, `/bump`, `/release` appear in `/` autocomplete; on a real AntD task,
frontend-design reads siblings before generating.

---

- **2026-08-11 — Portable config migration (office macOS → home Linux)**:

Adopted the curated office `.pi` into the home machine and made the config
fully portable. Driven by `pi-harness-engineer.md` + the office `skills-audit.md`.

  - **Adopted** (`.pi/agent/` office copy → `~/.pi/agent/`):
  `AGENTS.md`, `skills/{ponytail,ponytail-review,frontend-design,refactoring-ui,brainstorming,systematic-debugging}/`,
  `skills-audit.md`, `skills-archive.tar.gz`, `zen-provider.template.json`.
  Kept existing `browser-tools` + `youtube-transcript` (merged, not replaced).
  - **settings.json**: `defaultThinkingLevel` max → **medium** (token efficiency; office's curated default).
  - **AGENTS.md**: dropped hardcoded `~/Barikoi/` (path-agnostic); skill list generalized
  (no hardcoded count) + added the two tool skills.
  - **Neutralized** stale `~/.agents/skills` (7 legacy skills pi auto-scans) → renamed
  `~/.agents/skills.disabled.<ts>`. Matches office audit end-state; removes always-on
  description tax from skills that were never used (per skills-audit.md §2).
  - **Created** portable infra (all inside `~/.pi/agent/`):
  `PORTABILITY.md`, `setup.sh` (idempotent per-machine), `bundle.sh` (GDrive tarball),
  this `CHANGELOG.md`.
  - **Not bundled** (machine-local/auto-regenerated): `bin/{fd,rg}`, `npm/node_modules/`,
  `sessions/`, logs. See PORTABILITY.md.
  - **Why**: one `.pi` config, identical on every Linux/macOS box, replace-only sync,
  no env vars, minimal always-on tokens, cache-stable prefix.
  - **Risk**: low. All changes reversible; full backup at `~/.pi-backups/pi-agent.pre-portable.<ts>.tar.gz`.
  - **Portability**: fixed (was: macOS-only binary in `bin/`, hardcoded `~/Barikoi/`,
  `.agents` leakage). Now clean.

**Always-on token cost (post-change):** AGENTS.md ~960 tok + 8 skill descriptions
(~430 tok) ≈ **~1.4 K tok/session**; bodies stay on-demand. `defaultThinkingLevel`
medium cuts reasoning-token burn vs `max`.

**Next measurement:** `/reload` or fresh session; confirm exactly 8 skills load
(0 from `.agents`); try `bundle.sh` → dry-run extract on a temp dir to validate.

---

### Removed

- **2026-08-28 16:30Z — removed .env / .env.example (YAGNI)**:
  - Removed: `.env`, `.env.example` deleted; `.env` entry dropped from `.gitignore`.
  - Rationale: pi never reads .env (auth.json or plain env vars only); shell-rc loading ruled out; duplicated auth.json keys with drift risk. auth.json is the single secrets file.
  - Measured: index 65 files; PORTABILITY.md/HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md carry 0 stale .env/setup.sh/bundle.sh references (verified via rg).
  - Risk: none — secrets flow simplified to one-time `scp auth.json` per machine.

- **2026-08-28 16:05Z — removed setup.sh / bundle.sh; git-only sync finalized**:
  - Removed: setup.sh, bundle.sh deleted from disk and absent from index. Deprecated entries dropped from .gitignore comment context (paths still listed for safety).
  - Measured: index 66 files — all portable source-of-truth (AGENTS, settings/models.json, skills/ 14, prompts/, HARNESS docs, PORTABILITY, skills-audit, .nvmrc, .gitignore, .env.example). Ignored as intended: .env, auth.json, bin/, npm/, sessions/, models-store.json, logs, archives. 0 untracked non-ignored files.
  - Docs: PORTABILITY.md fully rewritten git-side (portable/not-portable tables, key rotation via .env, manual per-machine one-time setup incl. ~/.agents/skills neutralization one-liner); HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md tree + portability summary updated (no script refs).
  - Risk: low — per-machine setup is now 2 documented manual steps (secrets + legacy skills dir).

- **2026-08-12 — slash-command token fix: `/release` `/bump` `/changelog` (8k→~0 lockfile read)**:

**Prompt:** `/release` cost ~8k tokens and produced a CHANGELOG the user deleted.
Root-cause the prompts.

**Root cause (evidence):** the prompt *bodies* are tiny (~1 KB each) — not the
cost. The cost was **runtime reads**: `/release` + `/bump` instructed the model
to **hand-edit `package-lock.json`**, forcing a 50–100 KB lockfile into context
(~8–12 K tok) just to change two version strings. Secondary: unbounded `git log`
and loose changelog rules (verbose/noisy entries → deletable output).

**Changed (native tool over hand-editing — ponytail rule 4):**
  - `release.md` + `bump.md`: lockfile step now runs `npm install --package-lock-only`
  (the tool syncs root + `packages."".version`); **explicit "never read the lockfile
  into context — 8k-token trap"**. `pnpm-lock.yaml`/`yarn.lock` store no root
  version → skipped (was: "hand-edit / run update command for approval").
  - `release.md` + `changelog.md`: `git log --no-merges … | head -60` (was unbounded).
  - `release.md` + `changelog.md`: changelog entries now ≤10 words, user-facing,
  omit chores/CI/docs; **insert-only** (never rewrite existing entries) — the
  quality rules the deleted output lacked.

**Not changed:** `/commit` (963 B, already lean) and `/preflight` (1647 B,
purpose-built) — no token issue.

  - **Measured:** body sizes barely moved (release 1834→1943, bump 1000→1021,
  changelog 1055→1059 B). The win is **runtime**: ~8 K tok lockfile read → ~0
  (one `npm install --package-lock-only`); git log now capped at 60 subjects.
  **Prefix byte-stable** (prompts are NOT always-on — 0 prefix tokens at rest) →
  no session restart needed.
  - **Risk:** low. `npm install --package-lock-only` is the canonical lockfile-sync
  (no `node_modules` touched); reversible by re-running. Worst case the command
  needs network for a dep change — but a version bump changes no deps.
  - **Portability:** clean — `npm`/`pnpm`/`yarn` branches, no paths, no OS commands.

- **2026-08-11 — bundle.sh auto-include rewrite (explicit FILES list → exclude-only)**:

Closes the "pending the portability-safe rewrite decision" thread from the prior
entry. The explicit `FILES` list duplicated PORTABILITY.md's *"What is NOT
portable"* table and had already drifted — `.nvmrc` + `HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md`
both had to be added retroactively (2 silent-omission bugs).

  - **Changed:** `bundle.sh` — deleted the 16-line `FILES` block + the `INC`-building
  loop; now ships **everything under `~/.pi/agent`** minus a top-level-anchored
  exclude set: `--exclude='node_modules' ./bin ./npm ./sessions *.log`. Header
  comment rewritten to state the auto-include contract + why each exclude exists.
  Excludes anchored to top-level (`./bin`, not bare `bin`) so a future skill
  `bin/` subdir is never clobbered.
  - **Why:** one source of truth for "machine-local" (the exclude set) instead of
  two (exclude set + hand-maintained include list). New portable files now ship
  with **zero script edits**; the whole silent-omission drift class is gone. The
  win is maintenance surface + a removed bug-class, not bytes.
  - **Measured:** `bundle.sh` **1276 → 1468 B** (+192 — longer comments explain the
  contract; the `FILES`/`INC` logic shrank). Produced tarball **76 members,
  identical to the explicit-list set** (`diff` empty, re-verified against the
  CURRENT tree, not last session's); bytes **471,609 → 470,852** (−757,
  mtime/ordering only). Leak check `bin/npm/sessions/node_modules/*.log` = **0**
  each. **Prefix byte-stable** (AGENTS.md 4713 B + 9 descriptions 2908 B
  untouched) → no session restart required. Skill count 9 → 9 (no skills-audit
  revision).
  - **Risk:** low. Reversible: `~/.pi-backups/bundle.sh.pre-auto-include.20260811-221738`
  (sha256 `ab01d6e2…`). Residual: a future machine-local *top-level* dir would
  ship until one `--exclude` line is added — but that set (`bin/npm/sessions`)
  is tiny/stable and `tar -tzf | head` catches any leak.
  - **Portability:** clean — no new paths, no OS-only commands, same POSIX `sh`;
  `--exclude` mechanism unchanged (GNU tar + BSD tar both supported).
